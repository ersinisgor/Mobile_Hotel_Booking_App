## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è

The project leverages the following technologies:

A framework for building native apps using React. This app is built using React Native, which allows us to use the same codebase for both iOS and Android apps.

### 2. **React Navigation** üß≠

Used for navigation between different screens within the app. This app uses **Stack Navigation** and **Bottom Tab Navigation** for smooth transitions between various app pages, such as the Home, List of Hotels, and Booking History screens.

### 3. **Redux** üõ†Ô∏è

State management is handled with **Redux**, ensuring that the app can manage and update the state efficiently, especially for user authentication and booking data.
